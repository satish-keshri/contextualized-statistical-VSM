# Analysis of Deficiencies in Drug Applications Using Contextualized Feature Extraction
## Abstract

Texts written in natural language are an unstructured data source that is hard for machines to comprehend. In recent years there has been an exponential growth in the number of complex documents and it requires a deeper understanding of the text contents to be able to accurately classify them. This thesis presents a domain specific contextualized embedding based approach to text classification. Many techniques have been proposed to infuse word embeddings into the statistical vector space model (VSM). However, previous methods mainly use traditional static embedding, but static word embeddings could not deal with the problem of polysemy. For this reason we propose to utilize contextualized word embeddings to effectively encode the text. In this study, we introduce a new vector space model called Contextualized Semantically Augmented Statistical Vector Space model (C-SAS-VSM). Our approach is an extension of existing Semantically Augmented Statistical Vector Space model (SAS-VSM) in which we leverage the power of both contextualized and static embeddings to generate more feature rich text representation. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the existing SAS-VSM approach in domain specific text classification task.
